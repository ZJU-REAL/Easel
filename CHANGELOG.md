# Changelog

All notable changes to Easel are documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Added the `video-production` Skill: an end-to-end video pipeline (probe → transcribe → scenes → design table → scaffold → verify → preview → render → deliver) with two human confirmation gates and quality gates (five-piece manifest, loudness, transitions). The upstream `video-pipeline-sdk` (MIT) is now vendored into the repo so the pipeline is self-contained, reproducible, and editable. Skill count is now 114.
- Added three-tier transcription with automatic fallback: SRT/VTT subtitles first, then SiliconFlow ASR API, then local whisper as a last resort — so a run no longer requires downloading the 3GB model when a transcript or API key is available.
- Added a **「笔」capability menu** to the workbench input area: click to browse everything Easel can do ("能做的都在这"); selecting an item prefills the prompt.
- Added a ffmpeg-based slideshow renderer for image-storyboard voiceover dramas (Ken Burns, differentiated transitions, libass dynamic captions, light whoosh SFX, loudnorm).

### Improved

- Improved the Skill library display: Chinese display names shown large with the original name beneath, kept in sync across search and the drawer.
- Improved in-conversation cards to support multi-select (`ask_user` multiSelect rendering and multi-value submission).
- Improved file uploads: files exceeding the upload limit are automatically converted to local materials via a copy channel (without changing the 50MB config).
- Improved reasoning visibility: `--thinking` now defaults to medium so chain-of-thought shows when the gateway supports it.

### Fixed

- Fixed chain-of-thought (CoT) display in the Web conversation: token/thinking now streams token-by-token, and the anti-stall heartbeat no longer overrides real status.
- Fixed the Gemini adapter to support `streamGenerateContent` streaming.
- Fixed UTF-8 persistence on Windows (state read/write) and migrated the shutdown hook to a lifespan handler.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/Easel/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Added WeChat Official Account (公众号) support: article publishing, Data Center metrics, and account management via a background QR-scan session.
- Added an optional vendored typesetting Skill (`gzh-design`, AGPL-3.0), bringing the Skill count to 113.

### Improved

- Improved the workbench **创作数据** panel: Bilibili and Douyin now populate "近 7 日 · 环比" (7-day metrics with week-over-week change) and "最近作品" (recent works).
  - Bilibili reads the creator overview API for play/like/comment/favorite/share/follower deltas, and lists recent uploads (title/link/cover/stats).
  - Douyin parses the real "近 7 日" labels with a section anchor to avoid mis-reading the "最新作品" card, handles the "较前7日±X" delta format, hardens polling stability, and scrapes recent works from the content-manage page.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenClaw version detection in `easel doctor` on Windows (the `.cmd` shim cannot be invoked bare).
- Fixed cross-platform gateway/launcher robustness and Xiaohongshu login navigation races.
